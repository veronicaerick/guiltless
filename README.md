Guiltless was created at the Expat Women's Hackathon ad Dev Bootcamp on September 10th. The project team consisted of 6 women- 5 developers and 1 UI designer. The theme of the hackathon was SF City Challenges - building app to encourage residents and tourists alike to explore the city and support small businesses. Guiltless is an app made to help with eliminating decision fatigue and providing the best options for a destination to eat or drink dependent on the day of the week and the user's location. Guiltless automatically creates an alliteration dependent on week day (think taco Tuesday), a distance to walk based on the user's choice (hop (.5 miles), skip (1 mile) or a jump (1.5 miles) and a google map for easy navigation to the location. We created this app to get people out and exploring the city by foot to indulge in finding city gems including bars, restaurants, food trucks and sweet spots (hence the name guiltless; if you're walking it off, did it even happen?). We wanted to make an app that used humor and narrowed down the endless amount of options there are for food and drink options in San Francisco to create a fun and easy experience for the user. Some of the technologies used: Python, Flask, Javascript, jQuery, Yelp API, Google Maps API, geocoding and HTML/CSS.
